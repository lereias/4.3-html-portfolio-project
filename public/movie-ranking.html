<h1>The Best Movies According to Lereias</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Wild Robot</h3>
<p>
  It has an interesting concept. Even robots can have emotions. It can even be
  more human than a human.
</p>
<h3>The Dictator</h3>
<p>
  The movie is very funny. There are many adult jokes being thrown out. The cast
  did pretty well on making us the audience laugh.
</p>
<h3>Hamilton</h3>
<p>Very nice musical. I have learned quite a lot about Alexander Hamilton.</p>
